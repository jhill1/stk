STK API
=======

The STK has been split such that the main functionality can be imported into
your own Python script and used programmatically. If you have downloaded the
source package there are a number of example scripts in the stk/scripts
directory. If you know Python, simply import the stk.supertree_toolkit module.
If you don't, then go and learn Python -- it's very useful.

Below is a description of the functions that are available in the API.
