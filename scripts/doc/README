The Supertree Tool Kit is a suite of Perl and Java tools designed to 
make the processing of source tree data, ready for inclusion in a supertree
phylogenetic analysis, easier.

This document describes how to make the documentation.

POD
----

All documentation is in POD format, embedded within the module and the exectuable scripts.
See http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html fo info on how to write POD.

Unifying the PODs
------------------

The POD in the various .pl and .pm files is then unified using the pod2include.pl script. This is
called with a header file, STK_header.pod

The header file contains include statements for each POD/perl file to include:

=for include ../exec/amalgamate_trees.pl

If a new module (i.e. other than lib/Bio/STK.pm) or an exectuable file is added to the 
STK, add the include statement.

The main documents can be generated using the script "make_docs.sh". This makes a master
POD document, which includes all the sub-PODs and then uses that to generate the HTML and Wiki
versions.

Just execute the script - that should do it.
