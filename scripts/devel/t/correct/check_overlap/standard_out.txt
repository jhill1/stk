======== WARNING ========
There were 10 clusters found, which means some trees are not
connected by 2 or more taxa. You may need to remove the trees
that are not connected to the main group of connected trees.

Run this script again with --graphic (and --compressed if the data are large)
to see which trees are not sufficiently well connected
