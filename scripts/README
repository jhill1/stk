Bio-STK version 0.04
=====================

STK is a perl module and collection of script designed to make processing
data for supertree analysis easier. It is not an automated system that 
blindly alters data: human intelligence is still required.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   cp _check.cfg ~/

You may need to alter these commands slightly for Windows machines, for example
using 'nmake' instead of 'make' and the final command will be
  copy _check.cfg ~\

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	- Test::More
	- XML::Simple
	- File::Find
	- File::Spec::Functions
	- File::Copy
	- Bio::NEXUS
	- Carp

The STK contains a devel folder that has a test suite for the executables
along with test datasets. This is only availble via SVN.

svn co https://stck.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stck/ stk

will download the latest snapshot which contains the devel folder. Please get in touch
with the authors via SourceForge to enable commit access.
