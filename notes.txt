Ideas:

Collect data, remove paraphyletic

Take taxonomy (from dbs), phyml, users knowledge (encoded as subs file) and information on synonyms (from dbs)
to create a master subs file that takes the dat to species level

User needs to be able to edit taxonomy - CSV file 

User needs to choose database source - preferred source.


Taxonomic name checker:

 - use database to get synonyms and possible mispellings
 - Gui is a 2 column table with green, yellow, red. User filles in red (or removes it), green is fine. Yellow - drop down list with alternatives.
 - Use this to generate a two column CSV file
 - On CLI, generate a three column CSV. Original name, new name (or blank for unknown) and a list of possibles. Warn user they *must* fill in the second column or remove the row or the taxa will be deleted.

For colloqual names, user adds to column 1 of taxonomy csv and then adds the latin name in the approriate column of the database. The subs can then generate the species list.

Use these two csv files to generate a subs file, including replacing higher taxa and genera to create a "to species" substtution (can also output this file for later)

Generating data to any taxonomic level can happen later - need to check each species is accounted for in the taxonomy, with correct levels - may need another parse of the taxonomy csv


Add data -> paraphyletic taxa -> taxonomy checker -> sub synonyms -> taxonomy generator -> create species level dataset

New functions:
 - taxonomic name checker (this might take a while when online for large dataset) - note that this should be a one for one substitution - seperate function so we can check this?
 - Pull in taxonomy generator
 - Add csv file to schema
 - amaend manual with workflow
 - warning on multiple subs in data in manual
 - generate species level subsfile from taxonomy
 - generate specified taxonomic level data
