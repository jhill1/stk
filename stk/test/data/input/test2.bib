  abstract = {The controversial interrelationships of the major clades of the reptant
	decapods are resolved by simultaneous analysis of 16S, 18S, and 28S
	rRNA sequences in combination with morphology. All major reptant
	clades are represented including the first molecular data for the
	controversial Polychelidae, Glypheidae, and Enoplometopidae. Interrelations
	hips of major clades ill the shortest morphological cladograms were
	identical to those based oil the molecular partition, and were congruent
	with those of the optimal combined analyses. The optimal tree, namely,
	that exhibiting minimal overall incongruence between morphological
	and molecular partitions was achieved under equal transition: transversion
	weights. Palinura, as traditionally recognised, is polyphyletic corroborating
	several recent Studies. Infraordinal relationships are robust and
	insensitive to transition weight variation. For clades previously
	comprising the Palinura, we recognise Achelata, Polychelida and Glypheidea.
	Polychelida is sister to the remaining Repantia. Achelata is near
	basal and sister to Fractosternalia. Contrary to many previous Studies,
	glypheideans are neither basal reptants, not, are they related to
	Thalassinidea, Brachyura or Anomra. Glypheidea is sister to Astacidea.
	A monophyletic Astacidea, comprising the freshwater crayfish (Astacida)
	and marine clawed lobsters (Homarida), corroborates most previous
	studies. The enigmatic lobster Enoplometopus (Enoplometopoidea) is
	confirmed as all astacidean rather than a possible thalassinidean.
	Unusual characters of the extinct uncinid lobsters, shared with enoplometopids,
	suggest close affinity, extending the fossil record of the Enoplometopoidea
	to the Lower Jurassic. The Sterropoda concept, comprising (Thalassinidea
	(Achelata + Meiura)) is not recognised. The clade formed by Brachyura,
	Anomura, and Thalassinidea is United by carapace lineae, for which
	we propose the new name Lineata. Internal relationships of Anomura
	recovered in our analyses suggest possible paraphyly of Galatheoidea
	and Paguroidea. Relationships within Brachyura indicate podotreme
	paraphyly, but greater taxonomic sampling is required to adequately
	test the status of Podotremata. The anomuran dromiid hypothesis is
	unsupported. Seven reptantian infraorders are recognised: Polychelida,
	Achelata. Glypheidea, Astacidea, Thalassinidea, Anomura and Brachyura.},
