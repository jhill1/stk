  abstract = {The Oleriina is one of the most speciose subtribes of the neotropical
	nymphalid butterfly tribe ithomiini. They are widely distributed
	across the Andes and Amazonian lowlands and like other ithomiines
	they are involved in complex mimicry rings. This subtribe is of particular
	interest because it contains the most diverse ithomiine genus, Oleria,
	as well as two genera, Megoleria and Hyposcada, that feed on hostplants
	not utilized elsewhere in the tribe. Here we present the first comprehensive
	species-level phylogeny for the Oleriina, representing 83% of recognised
	species in the group, and based on 6698 bp from eight mitochondrial
	(mt) and nuclear (nc) genes. Topologies are largely congruent for
	ncDNA and the concatenated dataset and the genera Oleria, Hyposcada
	and Megoleria are recovered and well-supported, although strongly
	discordant genealogy between mtDNA and ncDNA suggest possible introgression
	among Hyposcada and Megoleria. A fourth clade containing the type
	species of ollantaya is consistently recovered, and this recently
	synonymized name is resurrected. Clear subdivisions within Oleria
	separate the genus into four species groups, onega, amalda, makrena
	and aegle, which also correspond to differing biogeographic and elevation
	range characteristics. Unlike other ithomiine genera, the Oleriina
	show homogeneity in mimetic wing pattern, in sharp contrast to the
	emerging paradigm that mimetic shifts have enhanced diversification
	in the tribe. Our results show a potentially more important role
	for geographic isolation in the diversification of the Oleriina compared
	to other Ithomiini studied to date and provide a framework for more
	detailed biogeographical studies, in addition to a rare opportunity
	for comparative analyses with other neotropical groups. (C) 2010
