  abstract = {The controversial interrelationships of the major clades of the reptant
	decapods are resolved by simultaneous analysis of 16S, 18S, and 28S
	rRNA sequences in combination with morphology. All major reptant
	clades are represented including the first molecular data for the
	controversial Polychelidae, Glypheidae, and Enoplometopidae. Interrelations
	hips of major clades ill the shortest morphological cladograms were
	identical to those based oil the molecular partition, and were congruent
	with those of the optimal combined analyses. The optimal tree, namely,
	that exhibiting minimal overall incongruence between morphological
	and molecular partitions was achieved under equal transition: transversion
	weights. Palinura, as traditionally recognised, is polyphyletic corroborating
	several recent Studies. Infraordinal relationships are robust and
	insensitive to transition weight variation. For clades previously
	comprising the Palinura, we recognise Achelata, Polychelida and Glypheidea.
	Polychelida is sister to the remaining Repantia. Achelata is near
	basal and sister to Fractosternalia. Contrary to many previous Studies,
	glypheideans are neither basal reptants, not, are they related to
	Thalassinidea, Brachyura or Anomra. Glypheidea is sister to Astacidea.
	A monophyletic Astacidea, comprising the freshwater crayfish (Astacida)
	and marine clawed lobsters (Homarida), corroborates most previous
	studies. The enigmatic lobster Enoplometopus (Enoplometopoidea) is
	confirmed as all astacidean rather than a possible thalassinidean.
	Unusual characters of the extinct uncinid lobsters, shared with enoplometopids,
	suggest close affinity, extending the fossil record of the Enoplometopoidea
	to the Lower Jurassic. The Sterropoda concept, comprising (Thalassinidea
	(Achelata + Meiura)) is not recognised. The clade formed by Brachyura,
	Anomura, and Thalassinidea is United by carapace lineae, for which
	we propose the new name Lineata. Internal relationships of Anomura
	recovered in our analyses suggest possible paraphyly of Galatheoidea
	and Paguroidea. Relationships within Brachyura indicate podotreme
	paraphyly, but greater taxonomic sampling is required to adequately
	test the status of Podotremata. The anomuran dromiid hypothesis is
	unsupported. Seven reptantian infraorders are recognised: Polychelida,
	Achelata. Glypheidea, Astacidea, Thalassinidea, Anomura and Brachyura.},

  abstract = {The family Galatheidae is among the most diverse families of anomuran
	decapod crustaceans, and the South-West Pacific is a biodiversity
	hot spot for these squat lobsters. Attempts to clarify the taxonomic
	and evolutionary relationships of the Galatheidae on the basis of
	morphological and molecular data have revealed the existence of several
	cryptic species, differentiated only by subtle morphological characters.
	Despite these efforts, however, relationships among genera are poorly
	understood, and the family is in need of a detailed systematic review.
	In this study, we assess material collected in different surveys
	conducted in the Solomon Islands, as well as comparative material
	from the Fiji Islands, by examining both the morphology of the specimens
	and two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, COI,
	and 16S rRNA). These two sources of data revealed the existence of
	eight new species of squat lobster, four of which were ascribed to
	the genus Munida, two to the genus Paramunida, one to the genus Plesionida,
	and the last species was ascribed to the genus Agononida. These eight
	species are described along with phylogenetic relationships at the
	genus level. Our findings support the taxonomic status of the new
	species, yet the phylogenetic relationships are not yet fully resolved.
	Further molecular analysis of a larger data set of species, and more
	conserved genes, will help clarify the systematics of this group.

	two stations on the continental slope off Oman, at depths of 900
	and 1000 m, using an Agassiz trawl, Starch gel electrophoresis, across
	10 enzyme loci, was carried out on 427 specimens. Genetic variability
	was calculated for both populations using a number of parameters.
	F-statistics were used to estimate genetic variance within (F-IS)
	and between (F-ST) populations. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
	expectations were detected at one locus (Gotb), Analyses of F-IS
	revealed significant differences from zero at Gotb and Pgm, as a
	result of heterozygote deficiency. No relationship was observed between
	size of individuals and genotype. The number of genetically effective
	migrants per deme per generation (N(e)m) was calculated using both
	F-ST and private alleles methods. N(e)m values were theoretically
	sufficient to offset the effects of genetic drift. Additional morphometric
	analyses were carried out on Munidopsis scobina from the two populations.
	Individuals were sexed (n = 2476 individuals) and ten parameters
	measured (n = 1238). All specimens were examined for parasites (either
	bopyrid isopod or rhizocephalan). Significant male-biased sex ratios
	were observed in both populations (p < 0.01). In addition, significant
	differences in size-frequency distributions (p < 0.01) were recorded
	both within sires between sexes, and within sexes between sites;
	possibly related to a size-dependent response to hypoxia. Significant
	differences also were observed in mean cheliped length between sexes
	p < ( 0.01), potentially indicating that male nl. scobina exhibit
	agonistic behaviour. The genetic relationships of Munidopsis scobina
	to four other species of Munidopsis (M crassa, M parfaiti, M. spinihirsuta
	and M. subsquamosa) and the confamilial Galathea squamifera were
	also examined using allozyme loci. Within the genus Munidopsis, pairwise
	comparisons of genetic identity were within the normal range expected
	for congeneric species. Comparisons between G. squamifera a and Munidopsis
	spp. were within the range expected for confamilial genera. (C) 1999

  abstract = {Aim Members of the crustacean family Lithodidae share preferences
	for cold-water environments; however, the specific role of temperature
	in governing lithodid biogeography has not been examined to date.
	In the present study this relationship was quantified through the
	analysis of habitat data, and the results were interpreted in the
	light of previous physiological studies. It was hypothesized that
	lineage-specific temperature thresholds underlie differences in the
	distribution of the two lithodid subfamilies. Location The family
	Lithodidae is divided into the subfamilies Hapalogastrinae and Lithodinae.
	The Hapalogastrinae inhabit depths of between 0 and 200 m in the
	North Pacific. The Lithodinae are distributed globally in the deep
	sea, with a few genera occurring intertidally at high latitudes.
	Methods Descriptions of 86 species of lithodids, sampled at 627 locations
	worldwide, were obtained from a wide range of published and original
	sources. For each specimen, the water temperature at the time and
	locality of collection was recorded. Molecular sequence data for
	the 16S, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 28S genes were
	analysed to construct a phylogenetic tree for the major lithodid
	genera, using a maximum likelihood method in the program paup. Further
	analyses examined the link between the habitat temperature range
	and the position of taxa within the lithodid phylogeny. Results Phylogenetic
	evidence indicated that the deep-water lithodid lineages had ancestors
	that inhabited the coastal waters of the North Pacific. Adults of
	North Pacific lithodid taxa were found in regions where water temperatures
	ranged from 0 to 25 degrees C; however, deep-water lineages of the
	Lithodinae were excluded from waters exceeding temperatures of 13
	degrees C. Despite the higher temperatures tolerated by adults, North
	Pacific intertidal/subtidal genera were restricted to regions that
	had water temperatures lower than 16 degrees C during periods of
	larval development. Main conclusions Temperature has restricted the
	range of most shallow-water genera of Lithodidae to the coastline
	of the North Pacific since the early history of the family. Distribution
	in these groups remains constrained by the detrimental effects of
	temperature extremes on early life-history stages. Deep-water lineages
	moved away from seasonal temperature fluctuations, and underwent
	at least three radiations into water bodies outside the North Pacific.
	Species from within the deep-water lineages currently live close
	to the threshold of their temperature tolerance in the Southern Ocean,
	and their future distribution may be affected by increases in ocean
	temperature.},

	form, to the final crab-like form. Adaptation to dextral shell habitation
	evolved at least twice, once in an exclusively deep-water clade and

	been proposed based on morphological cladistic analyses. Recent molecular
	studies, however, yielded contrasting results despite their use of
	similar data (nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA). Here we present the
	first application of two nuclear protein-coding genes, phosphoenolpyruvate
	carboxykinase and sodium-potassium ATPase alpha-subunit, to reconstruct
	the phylogeny of major infraorders within Decapoda. A total of 64
	species representing all infraorders of Pleocyemata were analyzed
	with five species from Dendrobranchiata as outgroups. Maximum likelihood
	and Bayesian inference reveal that the Reptantia and all but one
	infraorder are monophyletic. Thalassinidea, however, is polyphyletic.
	The nodal support for most of the infraordinal and inter-familial
	relationships is high. Stenopodidea and Caridea form a clade sister
	to Reptantia, which comprises two major clades. The first clade,
	consisting of Astacidea, Achelata, Polychelida and three thalassinidean
	families (Axiidae, Calocarididae and Eiconaxiidae), corresponds essentially
	to the old taxon suborder Macrura Reptantia. Polychelida nests within
	Macrura Reptantia instead of being the most basal reptant as suggested
	in previous studies. The high level of morphological and genetic
	divergence of Polychelida from Achelata and Astacidea justifies its
	infraorder status. The second major reptant clade consists of Anomura,
	Brachyura and two thalassindean families (Thalassinidae and Upogebiidae).
	Anomura and Brachyura form Meiura, with moderate support. Notably
	thalassinidean families are sister to both major reptant clades,
	suggesting that the stem lineage reptants were thalassinidean-like.
	Moreover, some families (e.g. Nephropidae, Diogenidae, Paguridae)
	are paraphyletic, warranting further studies to evaluate their status.
	The present study ably demonstrates the utility of nuclear protein-coding
	genes in phylogenetic inference in decapods. The topologies obtained
	are robust and the two molecular markers are informative across a
	wide range of taxonomic levels. We propose that nuclear protein-coding
