  abstract = {Molecular phylogenetic relationships among members: of the odonate
	genus Libellula (Odonata: Anisoptera: Libellulidae) were examined
	using 735 bp of mitochondrial COI and 416 bp of 16S ribosomal RNA
	gene sequences. Considerable debate exists over several relationships
	within Libellula, as well over the status of two putative genera
	often placed as subgenera within Libellula: Ladona and Plathemis.
	Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of the separate and combined
	data sets indicate that Plathemis is basal and monophyletic and that
	Ladona is the sister clade to the remainder of Libellula sensu stricto
	(s.s.) (all. species within the genus Libellula, excluding Plathemis
	and Ladona). Moreover, two European taxa, Libellula fulva and L.
	depressa, were found to occupy a sister group relationship within
	the Ladona clade. Relationships within Libellula s.s. are less well
	resolved. However, monophyletic lineages within the genus are largely
	consistent with morphologically based subgeneric classifications.
	Although tree topologies from each analysis differed in some details,
	the differences were in no case statistically significant. The analysis
	of the combined COI and 16S data yielded trees with overall stronger
	support than analyses of either gene alone. Several analyses failed
	to support the monophyly of Libellula sensu late due to the inclusion
	df one or more outgroup species. However, statistical comparisons
	of topologies produced by unconstrained analyses and analyses in
	which the monophyly of Libellula was constrained indicate that any
	differences are nonsignificant. Based on morphological data, we therefore
	reject the paraphyly of Libellula and accept the outgroup status
	of Orthemis ferruginea and Pachydiplax longipennis. (C) 2001 Academic
